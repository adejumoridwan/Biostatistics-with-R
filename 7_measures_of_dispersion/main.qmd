# Range

## Range

- Difference between the highest and lowest value in a set of values.

## Range - limitations

- Can be influenced by extreme values

- Relies on only two extreme values

- A weak measure of variation.


# Variance

## Variance

- Measures the spread of numbers in a variable.

- Measures the dispersion of numbers from the mean in a dataset

- Square of standard deviations

- Mathematically represented as $\sigma^2$

## Variance - Limitations

- Sensitive to outliers

- Sensitive to unit of measurements 

- Assumption of normality, which is not always true in every dataset.


# Standard Deviation

## Standard Deviation

- Square root of variance

- Best measure of variation or dispersion

- Mathematically represented as $\sigma$

## Standard Deviation - Limitations

- Hard to calculate

- Affected by extreme values

- Doesn't reflect the full range of a data

- Can't be used for comparison between two variables measured with different units


# Coefficient of Variation

## Coefficient of Variation

- Corrects for differences in dispersion between two variables of different units.

- Ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of a data set, expressed in percentage.

$$
\text{cv}=\frac{\sigma}{\mu}\cdot\%\\
\text{cv}=\text{coefficient of variation}\\
\sigma = \text{standard deviation}\\
\mu = \text{mean}
