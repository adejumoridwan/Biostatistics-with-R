Here's a structured medical case study assignment using publicly available medical datasets in R, with a focus on descriptive statistics such as range, variance, standard deviation, and the coefficient of variation. The dataset used for this case study is the **"Pima Indians Diabetes Database"** (available in the `MASS` package or `mlbench` package), which contains health data that can be used to predict the onset of diabetes.

### **Case Study Assignment: Analysis of Health Variables in Predicting Diabetes**

#### **Objective:**
The goal of this assignment is to analyze health-related variables from a dataset of Pima Indian women and evaluate their statistical properties. Specifically, you will calculate the range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation for a set of health indicators and discuss their relevance to diabetes prediction.

#### **Dataset Description:**
The **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** consists of 768 observations of adult females of Pima Indian heritage. Each row contains health-related attributes and whether the patient was diagnosed with diabetes. The variables are:

- **Pregnancies**: Number of pregnancies
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
- **Age**: Age (years)
- **Outcome**: Class variable (0: no diabetes, 1: diabetes)

#### **Assignment Instructions:**

1. **Loading the Dataset:**
   Load the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset using the appropriate package in R (`mlbench` or `MASS`). Inspect the dataset to understand the structure and the variables.

   ```r
   # Load dataset
   library(mlbench)
   data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)
   df <- PimaIndiansDiabetes
   ```

2. **Summary Statistics:**
   - Calculate the **mean**, **median**, and **mode** (optional) for each numeric variable (e.g., glucose, blood pressure, insulin).
   - Provide a brief summary of what these statistics tell you about the dataset.

   ```r
   summary(df)
   ```

3. **Range, Variance, Standard Deviation:**
   - Calculate the **range**, **variance**, and **standard deviation** for the variables: Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, BMI, and Age.
   - Interpret these results. Discuss what the variability in each variable tells you about the population under study.

   ```r
   # Range
   range(df$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)
   range(df$BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE)
   # Repeat for other variables
   
   # Variance
   var(df$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)
   var(df$BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE)
   # Repeat for other variables
   
   # Standard Deviation
   sd(df$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)
   sd(df$BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE)
   # Repeat for other variables
   ```

4. **Coefficient of Variation (CV):**
   - Calculate the **coefficient of variation (CV)** for each variable (Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, BMI, and Age). CV is given by the formula:

     \[
     CV = \frac{\text{Standard Deviation}}{\text{Mean}} \times 100
     \]

   - Compare the CV across variables and discuss which variable has the greatest relative variability. What does this suggest about the importance of each variable in predicting diabetes?

   ```r
   # Coefficient of Variation (CV)
   cv_glucose <- (sd(df$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(df$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100
   cv_bp <- (sd(df$BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(df$BloodPressure, na.rm = TRUE)) * 100
   # Repeat for other variables
   ```

5. **Interpreting the Findings:**
   Based on your analysis:
   - Which variables show the greatest variation, and what might this imply about their role in diabetes risk?
   - How does the variability in these health indicators (like glucose and BMI) relate to the development of diabetes in this population?

6. **Optional Analysis - Grouped Analysis by Outcome:**
   If you want to dive deeper, you can separate the dataset by **Outcome** (diabetic vs. non-diabetic) and compute the same statistics for each group. Compare the variability in health indicators between those who have diabetes and those who do not.

   ```r
   # Subset for diabetic and non-diabetic groups
   diabetic <- df[df$Outcome == 1,]
   non_diabetic <- df[df$Outcome == 0,]
   
   # Calculate statistics for both groups
   mean(diabetic$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)
   mean(non_diabetic$Glucose, na.rm = TRUE)
   # Repeat for other variables and groups
   ```

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize your findings by reflecting on the importance of these descriptive statistics in understanding diabetes risk.
   - Discuss any insights you have gained about the relationship between variability in health metrics and the prediction of diabetes.

#### **Deliverables:**
- R code for loading, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset.
- A brief report (2-3 pages) summarizing the statistical findings and interpretation of the results.
  
**Bonus Task:**
If you're familiar with visualization, consider plotting the distribution of the health variables using boxplots or histograms to visually support your findings on variability.
