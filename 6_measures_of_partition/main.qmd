## Measures of Partition

- Quartiles 
- Percentiles
- Deciles



# Quartiles

## Quartiles

- Divided the data into four equal parts.

- There are three quartile points; Q1, Q2, and Q3.


## Quartiles - continued

- First quartile - 25%
- Second quartile(Median) - 25.1% - 50%
- Third quartile - 51% - 75%
- Fourth quartile - 25%

## Quartiles - continued 

- Semi interquartile range is half of the distance between the third and first quartile point. 

- Interquartile range is the difference between the upper and lower quartile of a dataset.

# Percentiles

## Percentiles

- Splits a data into 100.
- 25th percentile - Q1
- 50th percentile - Q2(median)
- 75th percentile - Q3

# Deciles

## Deciles

- Divides a distribution into ten equal parts

- 2nd decile is Q1
- 5th decile is the median
- 7th decile is Q3
