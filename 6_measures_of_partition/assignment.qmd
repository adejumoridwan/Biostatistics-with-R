Sure! For this case study, we'll use the **`"msleep"` dataset** from the **`ggplot2`** package, which contains data on sleep patterns and other characteristics of various mammals. Although it's not specifically a human health dataset, the data is relevant for health and biological insights regarding sleep. This can serve as a great context for understanding quartiles, deciles, and percentiles.

### **Case Study Assignment: Quartile, Decile, and Percentile Analysis Using the msleep Dataset**

**Objective:**  
In this assignment, you'll apply statistical measures such as quartiles, deciles, and percentiles to analyze mammalian sleep data. You will use R to load, clean, and analyze the dataset, and interpret these statistical measures with respect to sleep patterns (e.g., total sleep time, brain weight).

---

### **Steps and Code:**

#### Step 1: Load the Dataset and Perform Basic Data Cleaning

```r
# Load the ggplot2 package for access to the msleep dataset
if (!require("ggplot2")) {
  install.packages("ggplot2")
}
library(ggplot2)

# Load the msleep dataset
data("msleep")

# View the first few rows of the dataset
head(msleep)

# Remove rows with missing data for the columns we will use (e.g., total sleep time and brain weight)
msleep_clean <- na.omit(msleep[, c("sleep_total", "brainwt")])

# Summary of the cleaned dataset
summary(msleep_clean)
```

In this dataset:
- `sleep_total`: Total amount of sleep (in hours per day) for each mammal.
- `brainwt`: Brain weight (in kilograms).

#### Step 2: Calculate Quartiles for Total Sleep Time

Use the `quantile` function to calculate quartiles for total sleep time (`sleep_total`).

```r
# Calculate quartiles for total sleep time
sleep_quartiles <- quantile(msleep_clean$sleep_total, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75))
sleep_quartiles
```

#### Step 3: Calculate Deciles for Total Sleep Time

Now, let's calculate the deciles for total sleep time. Deciles split the data into ten equal parts.

```r
# Calculate deciles for total sleep time
sleep_deciles <- quantile(msleep_clean$sleep_total, probs = seq(0.1, 1, by = 0.1))
sleep_deciles
```

#### Step 4: Calculate Percentiles for Brain Weight

Percentiles divide the data into 100 equal parts. We'll calculate percentiles for brain weight (`brainwt`).

```r
# Calculate percentiles for brain weight
brainwt_percentiles <- quantile(msleep_clean$brainwt, probs = seq(0.01, 1, by = 0.01))
brainwt_percentiles
```

#### Step 5: Interpret the Results

- **Sleep Quartiles**: From the total sleep time quartiles, you'll understand how sleep is distributed across the species. For example, if the first quartile (Q1) is 8 hours, it means 25% of the species sleep less than 8 hours, while 75% sleep more.

- **Sleep Deciles**: Deciles provide a more granular breakdown. For instance, the 9th decile might tell you the value below which 90% of the species' sleep times fall.

- **Brain Weight Percentiles**: Brain weight percentiles will give insights into how brain sizes vary across mammals. If the 90th percentile of brain weight is 1.5 kg, it means 90% of species have a brain weight below 1.5 kg.

### **Conclusion:**
Based on your analysis, write a brief report summarizing your findings, interpreting the quartiles, deciles, and percentiles for total sleep time and brain weight, and discussing potential insights about sleep and brain size among different species.

### **Assignment Questions:**

1. **Describe the distribution of total sleep time using quartiles. What does each quartile represent?**
2. **Explain the difference between quartiles and deciles in the context of total sleep time.**
3. **What do the percentiles for brain weight tell you about the distribution of brain sizes across species?**
4. **Why is it useful to calculate percentiles in biological data analysis? Provide a real-world example.**
5. **Based on your findings, what insights can you draw about the relationship between sleep and brain size in mammals?**

### **Deliverables:**

- R script with the code for the analysis (Steps 1–4).
- A short report (300–500 words) interpreting the results and answering the assignment questions.
