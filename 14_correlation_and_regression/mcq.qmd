5. **In a simple linear regression model with `BMI` as the dependent variable and `Age` as the independent variable, what does a positive regression coefficient for `Age` imply?**
   - A) BMI decreases as age increases
   - B) BMI increases as age decreases
   - C) BMI increases as age increases
   - D) BMI is independent of age

   - D) The predictor is statistically insignificant  
   - **Answer:** C) The predictor increases the odds of the outcome occurring

8. **In the context of correlation, a correlation coefficient of 0 indicates:**
   - A) A perfect negative correlation
   - B) A weak positive correlation
   - C) No correlation
   - D) A strong positive correlation
