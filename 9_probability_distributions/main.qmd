# What is a Probability Distribution?

## What is a Probability Distribution?

- Distribution of the probability of all possible outcomes of a random variable

- Arrangement of the events and their corresponding probabilities in a tabular form

## What is a Probability Distribution? - Example

In a family of 4 children at a community, what is the distribution of the number of boys?

| X | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $P(x)$ | 0.413 | 0.236 | 0.211 | 0.090 | 0.05 |


# Terms and Terminologies

## Terms and Terminologies

- **Random Variable**: A variable  represents outcomes of a random process, that can either be discrete or continous.

- **Probaility Distributions**: Describes how probability is distributed over possible outcomes.

- **Probability Mass Function**: This is the given probability that a discrete random variable is exaclty equal to some value, and is used with discrete random variables

- **Probability Density Function**: This is the given probability of a random variable falling within a specific range of values, rather than a singl value. It is used for continous random variables.

- **Cumulative Distribution Function**: This is the probability tthat a random variable takes a value less that or equal to a certain value. It is the cumlative sum of probabilities for discrete variables and the integral of the PDF for contnous variables.

 - **Expected Vallue**: This is the long run average o outtcomes of a random varrible. Whih is also the average of all possible valuess that the random varible can take.

# Types of Probability Distribution

## Discrete Probability Distributtions

- Bernoulli Distribution
- Binomial Distribution


## Contnous Probability Distributions




# Bernoulli Distribution


# Poisson Distribution


# Normal Distribution
