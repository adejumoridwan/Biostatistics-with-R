# What is a Probability Distribution?

## Definition

- Distribution of the probability of all possible outcomes of a random variable
 
- Arrangement of the events and their corresponding probabilities in a tabular form

## Example

In a family of 4 children at a community, what is the distribution of the number of boys?

| $X$ | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $P(x)$ | 0.413 | 0.236 | 0.211 | 0.090 | 0.05 |


# Terms and Terminologies

## 

- **Random Variable**: A variable  represents outcomes of a random process, that can either be discrete or continous.

- **Probability Distributions**: Describes how probability is distributed over possible outcomes.

- **Probability Mass Function**: This is the given probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value, and is used with discrete random variables

## 

- **Probability Density Function**: This is the given probability of a random variable falling within a specific range of values, rather than a single value. It is used for continuous random variables.

- **Cumulative Distribution Function**: This is the probability that a random variable takes a value less that or equal to a certain value. It is the cumulative sum of probabilities for discrete variables and the integral of the PDF for continuous variables.

 - **Expected Value**: This is the long run average of outcomes of a random variable. Which is also the average of all possible values that the random variable can take.

# Types of Probability Distribution

## Discrete Probability Distributions

- Bernoulli Distribution
- **Binomial Distribution**
- **Poisson Distribution**
- Geometric Distribution
- Negative Binomial Distribution


## Continuous Probability Distributions

- **Normal (Gaussian) Distribution**
- Uniform Distribution
- Exponential Distribution
- Gamma Distribution
- Beta Distribution


# Binomial Distribution

## Definition

- If you have only two possible outcomes in $n$ independent number of trials, then the probability of exactly $X$ successes.

$$
P(X=x) = {n\choose x}p^x(1-p)^{n-x} \\
X = 1,2,3,\cdots, n
$$

- The total number of successes $X$ is a binomial variable with parameters $n$ and $p$.

  - where $n$ is fixed number of trials and
  - each trial results in a **success** with probability $p$ and a **failure** with probability $(1-p=1)$.
  
## Properties

- Trial has only two possible outcomes.
- Trials repeated $n$ times.
- Successive trials are independent.
- Probability of success is constant from trial to trial.
- The random variable $X$ is the number of successes in the $n$ trials.

## Mean and Variance

$$
\mu = np \\
\sigma = np(1-p) 
$$

## Example

- A drug is known to have a 90% success rate in curing a disease. A doctor treats 20 patients and wants to know the probability that exactly 18 patients will be cured.

- Suppose the probability of a positive result for a genetic disorder is 0.1, and 15 individuals are tested. What is the probability that exactly 3 individuals test positive?


# Poisson Distribution

## Poisson Distribution

- Distribution of a given variable $X$ with parameter $\lambda$, the average number of occurrences of an event in a given space, time or volume.

- Discrete events are observed in a continuous interval of time, space and volume.

- Occurrence of events is random (space or time)

- Probability of occurrence very small

- Trial size is large

- Events are rare

## Formular

$$
f(x) = P(X=x) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^x}{x!}
$$


## Properties 

- Used for rare events

- Used when the distribution are counts

- The mean and variance are the same, that is $\lambda = \sigma^2$


## Example

- If on average 4 patients experience a heart attack in a hospital per day, the Poisson distribution can model the probability of having exactly 6 heart attacks in a given day.

- On average, a hospital records 2 cases of hospital-acquired infections per week. What is the probability that there will be 5 such infections in a particular week?


# Normal Distribution

## Normal Distribution 

- Also known as **Gaussian Distribution**

- It is symmetric about its mean, median and mode

- It is **bell shaped**


## Parameters of the normal distribution

- mean ($\mu$)

- sigma ($\sigma$)

## Properties 

- It's bell shaped

- It's symmetrical about the mean value

- Determined by the mean and variance

- It's mean, median, and mode are equal

- Total area under the curve is **1 (100%)**

- **68%** of total observation approximately lie within **1SD** (left and right) of the mean value

- **95%** of total observation approximately lie within **1.96SD** (left and right) of the mean value
 
- Over **99%** of total observation approximately lie within **2.576SD** (left and right) of the mean value.

## Uses of Normal Disribution

- When $n$ is large, the binomial distribution approximates to a normal distribution.

- It is the foundation of other distributions (e.g chi-square, F-distribution, T-distribution, etc)

## Standard Normal Distribution

Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.

## Transforming of Standard normal distribution

- Standardizing involves subtracting each observation from the mean and diving by the standard deviation.

- This process is also known as computing the z-score.

$$
z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}
$$
