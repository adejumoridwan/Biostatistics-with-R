# Diabetes Medical Data Analysis Case Study

## Background
**Dataset:** Diabetes Dataset from MASS package

**Scenario:**
You are a medical data analyst working with a research team investigating factors influencing diabetes progression. Your goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the key risk factors and predictive markers for diabetes.

## Dataset Overview
The diabetes dataset contains the following key variables:
- Age
- Sex
- Body Mass Index (BMI) Proxy
- Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
- Total Cholesterol (TC)
- Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)
- High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)
- Triglycerides (TCH)
- Glucose Levels
- Diabetes Progression Marker (Target Variable)

## Research Objectives

### 1. Descriptive Analysis
- Characterize the demographic and clinical profile of the patient cohort
- Identify distributions of key medical markers
- Explore relationships between variables

### 2. Risk Factor Identification
- Determine statistically significant factors associated with diabetes progression
- Develop risk categorization model
- Investigate potential predictive markers

### 3. Predictive Modeling
- Build machine learning models to predict diabetes progression
- Compare performance of different modeling approaches
- Assess key predictive features

## Analytical Approach

### Statistical Methods
1. Descriptive Statistics
   - Summary measures
   - Visualization of distributions
   - Correlation analysis

2. Hypothesis Testing
   - Independent t-tests
   - ANOVA
   - Correlation tests
   - Chi-square tests of independence

3. Predictive Modeling
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest Classification
   - ROC Curve Analysis

## Ethical Considerations
