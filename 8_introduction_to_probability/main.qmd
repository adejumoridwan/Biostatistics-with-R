# Why Probability?

## Why Proability


-   Make inference from data.

-   Check for the significance of our statistic.

## Why Probability

-   Imagine a pharmaceutical company that developed a new vaccine to prevent a viral infection.

-   Before release, it is important to if it is safe and effective.

-   Probability makes it easy to quantify the uncertainty of the data.

-   Probability let's us know factors that might influence a patients resistance.

-   The more factors controlled in the trial, the more accurate the probability estimate is.

# Defining Probability

## What is Probability?

-   This is a measure of the likelihood or uncertainty of an event.

-   Probability ranges from **0** to **1**.

## Ways of Defining Probability.

-   Classical Probability

-   Empirical Definition

-   Subjective Definition

## Classifcal Probability

-   This is probability gotten from prior information, where all outcomes are equally likely to occur.

-   Examples:

    -   Rolling a fair die **($\frac{1}{6}$)**.

    -   Flipping a fair coin **($\frac{1}{2}$)**.

## Empirical Probability

-   This is based on actual observations or experiments.

- Measures the likelihood of an event through trials.

-   Examples:

    -   Weather Forecasting.

    -   Sports Peformance

    -   Traffic Accidents

## Subjective Probability

-   This is probability based on personal judgement.

-   Examples:

    -   Medical Diagnosis

    -   Business Decisions

# Terms and Definintions

## Terms and Definitions

- **Experiment** - Any process which when repeated generates a set of observed results.

- **Trial** - Act of conducting an experiment.

- **Outcome** - The result of a trial.

- **Sample Space** - Totality of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

- **Equally Likely** - All outcomes of an experiment having the same chance of occurence.

## Events

- **Event** - Set of outcomes of an experiment defined by a given rule.

  - **Simple Event** - Result of an experiment that results to only one outcome of interest.
  
  - **Compound Events** - More than one possible outcome of an event.
  
  - **Mutually Exclusive Events** - Two events A and B are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur together. 
  
  - **Independent Events** - Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affects the occurrence of the other event. 
  
## Probability Values

- **0** - means an event did not take place.

- **1** - means the event is sure to take place

## Complement of an event 

- This is an event that occurs when the other event fails.

- If the probability of surviving an epidemic is **0.65**, then the probability of dying from the epidemic is $1 - 0.65 = 0.35$

## Notations

- Intersection **(and)** - $A \bigcap B$

- Union **(or)** - $A \bigcup B$


# Types of Probability

## Types of Probability

- Joint Probability of an event is $P(A \bigcap B)$. 
  - If  $P(A \bigcap B)=0$, A and B are mutually exclusive.

- Conditional probability of an event A is given as.

  $$
  P(A/B) = \frac{P(A\bigcap B)}{P(B)}
  $$
  - If $P(A \bigcap B)=0$, the two events are mutually exclusive.
    
  - If $P(A/B)=P(A)$, if the events are independent.
    
  - $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are known as the marginal probabilities of an event A and event B.
  
# Additions and Multiplication Rule of Probability

## Additions and Multiplication Rule of Probability

$$
P(A \text{ or } B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \text{ and } B) \\
P(A \bigcup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \bigcap B)
$$
- When the events are mutually exclusive, $P(A \text{ and } B)=0$
