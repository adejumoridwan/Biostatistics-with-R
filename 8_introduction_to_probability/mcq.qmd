**Correct Answer:** C) Probability based on an individual's personal belief or opinion.

#### Question 6:

- A) 0.4
- B) 0.6
- C) 0.2
- D) 0.8

**Correct Answer:** B) 0.6

The probability of a patient testing positive for a virus, given that they have already shown symptoms, is called:
- A) Joint Probability
- B) Marginal Probability
- C) Conditional Probability
- D) Complementary Probability

**Correct Answer:** C) Conditional Probability

#### Question 8:
If the probability of a drug being effective is 0.9 and the probability of a patient developing a side effect is 0.1, assuming independence, what is the probability of both the drug being effective and the patient developing a side effect?
- A) 0.8
- B) 0.1
- C) 0.09
- D) 0.81

**Correct Answer:** C) 0.09

#### Question 9:
Which of the following best represents the **addition rule** for the probability of two events, A and B?
- A) \(P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B)\)
- B) \(P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)\)
- C) \(P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) + P(B)\)
- D) \(P(A) = P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)\)

**Correct Answer:** B) \(P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)\)

#### Question 10:
In a vaccine trial, if the probability of no side effect is 0.8, what is the probability of having at least one side effect?
- A) 0.2
- B) 0.4
- C) 0.8
- D) 1.0

**Correct Answer:** A) 0.2

### Explanation of Correct Answers:
1. **Empirical Probability** is based on observed data from experiments or trials.
2. **Mutually exclusive events** cannot happen at the same time, so the probability of both occurring is zero.
3. The **complement** rule states that the probability of an event not occurring is \( 1 - P(\text{event}) \).
4. For **independent events**, the probability of both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.
5. **Subjective probability** is based on personal judgment rather than objective data.
6. The complement of a **mild side effect** happening is calculated as \( 1 - P(\text{mild}) \).
7. **Conditional probability** considers the probability of an event given another event has already occurred.
8. **Independent probabilities** multiply, so the joint probability is \( 0.9 \times 0.1 = 0.09 \).
9. The **addition rule** accounts for overlap when adding probabilities.
10. The complement rule gives the probability of **at least one side effect** as \( 1 - P(\text{no side effect}) \).
