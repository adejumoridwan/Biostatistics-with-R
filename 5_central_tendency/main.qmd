## Descriptive statistics

- Branch of statistics that involves summarizing, organizing and presenting data in a meaningful way.
- Main objective is to provide a clear and concise summary of a data.
- Data can be described either numerically or graphically.

## Type of Descriptive Statistics

- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Variability:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Inter-quartile range
- **Measures of Partition:** Quartiles, Percentiles, Deciles


## Measures of Central Tendency

- Single value reflecting the center of a data distribution.
- Gives a summary of a variable.

# Mean

## Definition

- Average of a given set of values
- Denoted mathematically as $\bar{x}$
- 

## Example

- The weight of $5$ students in a class is given as $56, 54, 79, 63, \text{and } 51$
- The average weight is the sum of all the weight divided by the number of students in the class which is $60.6$.

## Merits of the Mean

- It is easy to calculate and understand.
- It is based upon all the observations of a variable.
- It is unique and can be used to compare different sets of data.

## Demerits of the Mean

- Easily affected by extreme values
- Can't be located graphically or by inspection
- Can only be used with numerical variables
- Can't be used when there are presence of missing observations
- Easily affected by sample size, smaller sample size give a more accurate estimate of the true population mean.

## Types of Mean

- Arithmetic Mean
- Geometric Mean
- Harmonic Mean

## Arithmetic Mean

- Also known as average, is the ratio of the sum of all observations to the total number of observations.
- For example the average weight of patients in an hospital is 65kg

## Geometric Mean

- nth root of the product of all observations in a variable.
- Always less than the arithmetic mean
- For example the ages of children in a primary health care center is given as follows:
  - $12, 10, 11, 8, 7$
  - The aritmetic mean is given as $9,6$
  - The geometric mean is given as $9.4$
  
## Harmonic mean

- Reciprocal of the arithmetic mean i.e reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals of the data values.
- Good at handling extreme values
