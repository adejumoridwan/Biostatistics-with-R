# Descriptive Statistics and Measures of Central Tendency.

## Descriptive statistics

- Branch of statistics that involves summarizing, organizing and presenting data in a meaningful way.
- Main objective is to provide a clear and concise summary of a data.
- Data can be described either numerically or graphically.

## Type of Descriptive Statistics

- **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode
- **Measures of Variability:** Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, Inter-quartile range
- **Measures of Partition:** Quartiles, Percentiles, Deciles


## Measures of Central Tendency

- Single value reflecting the center of a data distribution.
- Gives a summary of a variable.

# Mean

## Definition

- Average of a given set of values
- Denoted mathematically as $\bar{x}$


## Example

- The weight of $5$ patients in a hospital is given as $56, 54, 79, 63, \text{and } 51$
- The average weight is the sum of all the weight divided by the number of patients in the hospital which is $60.6$.

## Merits of the Mean

- It is easy to calculate and understand.
- It is based upon all the observations of a variable.
- It is unique and can be used to compare different sets of data.

## Demerits of the Mean

- Easily affected by extreme values
- Can't be located graphically or by inspection
- Can only be used with numerical variables
- Can't be used when there are presence of missing observations
- Easily affected by sample size, smaller sample size give a more accurate estimate of the true population mean.

## Types of Mean

- Arithmetic Mean
- Geometric Mean
- Harmonic Mean

## Arithmetic Mean

- Also known as average, is the ratio of the sum of all observations to the total number of observations.
- For example the average weight of patients in an hospital is 65kg

## Geometric Mean

- $n_\text{th}$ root of the product of all observations in a variable.
- Always less than the arithmetic mean
  
## Harmonic mean

- Reciprocal of the arithmetic mean i.e reciprocal of the average of the reciprocals of the data values.
- Good at handling extreme values.

## Example

The ages of children in a primary health care center is given as follows - $12, 10, 11, 8, 7$: 

- The arithmetic mean is given as $9.6$
- The geometric mean is given as $9.4$
- The harmonic mean is given as $9.22$

# Median

## Median 

- The middle number when the data is sorted.
- Also used as an average in the presence of extreme values.
- A case when the number of observations is even, and the median values are two, take the average of the two numbers and divide by 2.


## Median

## Median - Example

- The age of women attending ANC were recorded as follows.
$23, 19, 21, 20, 23, 21, 22, 24, 22, \text{ and 22}$

- **Step 1:** Arrange in ascending order.

  $19, 20, 21, 21, 22, 22, 22, 23, 23, 23, 24$

- **Step 2:** Pick the middle observation.

  The middle observation is 22 and 22, hence the median is $\frac{22 + 22}{2} = 22$

# Mode

## Mode

- The most occuring observation in a given set of data.
- Mode can either be **Bimodal**, **Trimodal**, or **MultiModal**.


## Mode - Example 

- If the temperature of 12 rabbits are $23, 19, 21, 20, 23, 21, 22, 24, 22, \text{ and } 22$.
- The mode is given as $22$.

# Skewness

## Skewness - Definition

- Measure of the deviation of a given variable from a symmetric distribution.
- A data is symmetric if the Mean, Median and Mode are all equal.


## Skewness - Types of Skewness

**Positive Skewness**

- Higher extreme values.
- Has a tail on the right
- Mean > Median > Mode

**Negative Skewness**

- Lower extreme values.
- Has a tail on the left.
- Mean < Median < Mode

## Calculating and Interpreting Skewness

$$ Skewness = \frac{\text{Mean}-\text{Median}}{Standard Deviation}$$

**Interpretation**

- Zero, if a perfect Symmetrical distribution.
- Negative, when negatively skewed or skewed to the left.
- Positive, when positively skewed or skewed to the right.

## Comparison of Median and Mean

| Median | Mean |
| --- | --- |
| Insensitive to extreme values | Sensitive to extreme values |
| Defines the central value of the data | Defines the midpoint of the data |
| Used with symmetric distributions | Used with skewed distributions |
| Affected by external factors | Robust and reliable |
