   - B) `median()`
   - C) `mode()`
   - D) `summarize()`

### Median

**4.** The median is best described as:

   - C) The middle value when a dataset is ordered from least to greatest **(Answer)**
   - D) The sum of all values divided by the number of values

**5.** If a dataset has an even number of observations, how is the median calculated?

   - B) It is the mode of the dataset
   - C) It is the value of the middle observation

### Mode

**6.** Which of the following best defines the mode?

   - B) The middle value in a sorted dataset
   - C) The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset **(Answer)**
   - D) The range of the dataset

**7.** In a dataset, if no value repeats, what can be said about the mode?
   - A) The dataset has no mode **(Answer)**
   - B) The mode is the first value
   - C) The mode is the mean

### Skewness

**8.** What does positive skewness in a dataset indicate?
   - A) The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side
   - B) The tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left side **(Answer)**
   - C) The distribution is symmetric
