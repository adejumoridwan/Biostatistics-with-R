Let's adjust the case study to focus on different variables. Hereâ€™s an updated version:

### Case Study Assignment: Descriptive Statistics Using the `birthwt` Dataset from the `MASS` Library in R

#### Introduction
The `birthwt` dataset from the `MASS` library in R contains data on the birth weight and various risk factors of 189 infants. This case study focuses on analyzing measures of central tendency, including the mean, median, mode, skewness, and the comparison of the mean and median for selected variables. The goal is to understand the distribution of these variables and assess how representative the measures of central tendency are.

#### Section 1: Mean
- **Task:** Calculate the mean for the variables `bwt` (birth weight), `lwt` (mother's weight), and `ftv` (number of physician visits during the first trimester).
- **Objective:** Interpret the mean values and discuss what they reveal about the typical birth weight, mother's weight, and frequency of early physician visits.
- **Question:** How does the mean birth weight compare to the overall data range? Is the mean a good representation of the typical value?

#### Section 2: Median
- **Task:** Compute the median for the same variables (`bwt`, `lwt`, `ftv`).
- **Objective:** Compare the median values to the mean values and discuss any differences.
- **Question:** In cases where the mean and median differ significantly, what might this indicate about the distribution of the data?

#### Section 3: Mode
- **Task:** Identify the mode for the variables `bwt`, `lwt`, and `ftv`.
- **Objective:** Discuss how frequently the mode occurs and whether it provides additional insight compared to the mean and median.
- **Question:** Is the mode a useful measure of central tendency for these variables? Why or why not?

#### Section 4: Skewness
- **Task:** Calculate the skewness for the variables `bwt`, `lwt`, and `ftv`.
- **Objective:** Interpret the skewness values to determine the direction and extent of asymmetry in the data.
- **Question:** How does skewness affect the relationship between the mean and median? What does a positive or negative skew indicate about the distribution of the data?

#### Section 5: Mean and Median Comparison
- **Task:** Compare the mean and median for each of the variables (`bwt`, `lwt`, `ftv`).
- **Objective:** Assess which measure of central tendency is more appropriate for each variable, considering the skewness and presence of outliers.
- **Question:** In which cases is the median a better measure than the mean? Provide specific examples from the dataset to support your argument.

#### Conclusion
Summarize the findings from each section, highlighting the most informative measure of central tendency for each variable. Discuss any broader implications for understanding the distribution of birth weights, maternal weight, and early prenatal care in the dataset.
