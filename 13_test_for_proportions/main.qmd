# Test of Proportion

## Test of Proportion

- Involves categorical values

- Two possible outcomes **Success** or **Failure**

- Population proportion of success is denoted by p

## What is Proportion?

- Fraction of the total population that possesses a certain attribute.

- For example, what is the proportion of men in a given sample of 10 that have systolic high blood pressure above 120

- I 4 men have systolic high blood pressure above 120, then $p = 4/10$

- Proportion can also be expressed in terms of percentage $p = 4/10\dot100 = 40$

## Sampling distribution of a proportion

- As sample size increases, sampling distribution of $\cap{p}$ becomes approximately normal 

- The mean of the sampling distribution is $p$

- The standard deviation of the sampling disribution is $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

## One sample Z- test for population proportion - Assumptions

- Sample is randomly selected

- Observations are dichotomous

- Observations are independent of each other

- Sample size is large 


## Two sample Z-test for populaion proportion - Assumptions

- Same as that of one sample

- The two samples are indpendent of each other

# Test of Association

## What is a Contingency table?

- Dispaly association between two catgorical variables

- One or both of which has more tha two possible values

## Examples

- Smoking and Lung Cancer

|  | Have Lung Cancer | Does not have Lung Cancer | Total | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Smoke |  |  |  |
| Does not smoke |  |  |  | 
| Total |  |  |  |

## Chi-square test statistic $\chi^2$ - Assumptions

- Samples are randomly selected

- Observations are categorical 

- Independence of Observations

- Each cell in the contingency table should have at least an expeced frequency of 5 in at most 20% of the cells

- No cells should have expected frequency of 0

- Large sample size

## Chi-square test statistic limitations

- Does not describe the strength of relationships

- Sensitive to sample size

- Sensitive to low expected frequencies

## Fisher's Exact Test

- Used in place of chi-square test when 
    - Cell counts are sparse

    - More than 20% of the cells have expected frequencies of less than 5

    - Sample size is small $n<20$
