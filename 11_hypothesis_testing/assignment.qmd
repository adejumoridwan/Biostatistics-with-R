# Blood Pressure Analysis Case Study Using Pressure Dataset
**For Medical Statistics Students**

## Background Information
In medical research, understanding pressure measurements and their variations is crucial for various physiological studies. The 'pressure' dataset in R contains temperature measurements that we will analyze as blood pressure readings for this educational exercise. Consider that you are a medical researcher investigating whether your patient population's blood pressure measurements differ from an established norm of 120 mmHg.

## Dataset Description
The dataset 'pressure' is available in base R and contains:
- A series of pressure measurements
- Each measurement represents a blood pressure reading (mmHg)
- The data was collected under standardized conditions
- For this exercise, we will treat the temperature values as blood pressure measurements

## Your Task
As a medical statistics consultant, you need to analyze this dataset and determine if the blood pressure measurements in this population significantly differ from the established norm of 120 mmHg using a one-sample t-test.

## Assignment Questions

### 1. Data Exploration (15 points)
a) Using the pressure dataset in R:
   - Calculate the mean blood pressure
   - Find the standard deviation
   - Report the minimum and maximum values
   - Determine the median
   - Create a summary of the basic statistics

b) Create and interpret:
   - A histogram of the blood pressure readings
   - A boxplot of the data
   What do these visualizations tell you about the distribution of the measurements?

c) Are there any outliers in the dataset? If so, how might these affect your analysis?

### 2. Hypothesis Testing (20 points)
a) State your hypotheses:
   - Write the null hypothesis (H₀)
   - Write the alternative hypothesis (H₁)
   - Express these in both statistical notation and plain English

b) Before conducting the test:
   - What significance level (α) will you use? Justify your choice.
   - What assumptions need to be met for a one-sample t-test?
   - Verify these assumptions using appropriate methods

c) Conduct the one-sample t-test:
   - Test against the hypothesized mean of 120 mmHg
   - Show your R code
   - Report all relevant test statistics

### 3. Results Interpretation (25 points)
a) Based on your analysis:
   - Interpret the 95% confidence interval
   - What does this interval tell us about the population mean?
   - How precise is your estimate?

b) Statistical Decision:
   - State your p-value
   - Compare it to your chosen α
   - Make a decision about the null hypothesis
   - Explain what this means in the context of blood pressure measurements

c) Discuss potential errors:
   - What would a Type I error mean in this context?
   - What would a Type II error mean?
   - Which type of error would be more serious for this medical application?

### 4. Clinical Significance (20 points)
a) Address the following:
   - Is the difference between your sample mean and 120 mmHg clinically meaningful?
   - How would you determine what constitutes a clinically significant difference?
   - What other factors should medical professionals consider beyond statistical significance?

b) Consider the implications:
   - How might these findings affect patient care?
   - What recommendations would you make to medical staff?
   - What additional research questions does this analysis raise?

### 5. Study Limitations and Recommendations (20 points)
a) Discuss limitations such as:
   - Sample size considerations
   - Data collection methods
   - Generalizability of results
   - Any violations of statistical assumptions

b) Provide recommendations for:
   - Improving the study design
   - Additional statistical analyses that might be valuable
   - Future research directions
